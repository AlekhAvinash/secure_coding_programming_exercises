# can you figure out the logic here?

ay = "a"
bee = "b"

# which one is bigger?

print(ay > bee)

# why??
print("the ord function maps any character to it's ascii value in this case 'a' == 97 and 'b' == 98")
# here is a hint: check out the ord() function
# How does python store string characters under the hood?
# look up what ord() does online and report back!
